About
========================================
This storyboard presents the results of all the 12 case studies performed in the book, "Text Mining: An Uncharted Territory for Librarians". The numbers 1A, 1B, 4B and so on, indicate the case study for that particular chapter and the letter represents the analysis from different tools, for instance, 1A shows the results from Chapter 1 for clustering using Orange tool and 1B shows the results from Chapter 1 for clustering using R. To know more about the case studies, and the methodology used to get the results, kindly read the book available on Springer.

1A {.storyboard}
========================================

### Heatmap showing distances between documents

***
The heatmap plot shows the distances between the documents.

### Clustered Heatmap showing distances between documents

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_1.2.png)

***
The clustered heatmap plot shows another way to visualize the distances between the documents.

### Dendogram showing hierarchical clustering of documents

***
The dendogram presents the hierarichal clustering of documents using the ward method.


1B {.storyboard}
========================================

### Determine the number of K for clustering using Elbow Method

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_1.png)

***
For clustering in R, elbow method was used to determine the number of clusters.


### Visualizing distance matrices 

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_2.png)

***
Euclidean distance method was used to determine the distance between the documents. 


### Agglomerative hierarchical clustering

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_3.png)

***
Hierarchical clustering with dendrograms is another way to visualise the distance between the documents. 

### Circular Dendogram

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_4.png)

***
Circular dendogram is yet another way to visualise the distance between the documents. 


### Phylogenic Dendogram

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_5.png)

***
Phylogenic structure is another way of visualizing the same results with different perspective according to your research problem and dataset.

### Method 2: Plotting MAP histogram using stm package

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_4c_2.png)


***
The figure shows second way of representing the results from Method 1. 

### Method 3: Visualizing topic model using ggplot2

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_4c_6.png)

***
The figure shows third way of representing the results from Method 1 and 2.

### Method 4: Interactive Visualization

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/case_study_4c_8.png)

***
The figure shows fourth way of representing the results from Method 1, 2, and 3.

### Understanding topics through top 5 representative documents

![©2021 Lamba and Madhusdhan - all rights reserved](~/flexboard/images/4c_9.png)

***
The Table presents the result for top five representative ETDs for the modeled topics and are ranked according to their probability.


### Topic correlation
