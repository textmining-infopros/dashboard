About
========================================
This storyboard presents the results of all the 12 case studies performed in the book, "Text Mining: An Uncharted Territory for Librarians". The numbers 1A, 1B, 4B and so on, indicate the case study for that particular chapter and the letter represents the analysis from different tools, for instance, 1A shows the results from Chapter 1 for clustering using Orange tool and 1B shows the results from Chapter 1 for clustering using R. To know more about the case studies, and the methodology used to get the results, kindly read the book available on Springer.

### Determine the number of K for clustering using Elbow Method

```{r}
#Load libraries
library(readr)
library(proxy)
library(RTextTools)
library(fpc)
library(wordcloud)
library(cluster)
library(tm)
library(stringi)
library(textmineR)
library(factoextra)
library(ggplot2)

#Load dataset from the github
data <- read.csv("clustering_sample_data.csv")

#Create Document Term Matrix
dtm <- CreateDtm(doc_vec = data$Abstract,
                 doc_names = data$S.No.,
                 ngram_window = c(1,2),
                 stopword_vec = c(stopwords::stopwords("en"),
                                  stopwords::stopwords(source = 'smart')),
                 lower = TRUE, 
                 remove_punctuation = TRUE,
                 remove_numbers = TRUE,
                 verbose = FALSE,
                 cpus = 2)

#Construct matrix of term counts to get IDF vector
tf_mat <- TermDocFreq(dtm)

#TF-IDF
tfidf <- t(dtm[ , tf_mat$term ]) * tf_mat$idf
tfidf <- t(tfidf)

#Convert TF-IDF matrix to standard R matrix
m <- as.matrix(tfidf)

#Determine the number of K for clustering
fviz_nbclust(m, kmeans, method = "wss") + geom_vline(xintercept = 5, linetype = 2) + labs(subtitle = "Elbow Method")
```

***
For clustering in R, elbow method was used to determine the number of clusters.


### Visualizing distance matrices 

```{r}
#Compute Distance Matrix
require(stats)
res.dist <- dist(x=m, method = "euclidean")

#Visualizing distance matrices
fviz_dist(res.dist)
```

***
Euclidean distance method was used to determine the distance between the documents. 


### Agglomerative hierarchical clustering

```{r}
# Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
require(stats)
res.hc <- hclust(d = res.dist, 
                 method = "ward.D")

#Coloring Dendogram
require(factorextra)
require(ggsci)
fviz_dend(x=res.hc, cex = 0.8, lwd = 0.8, k=5, rect = TRUE, k_colors = "jco", rect_border = "jco", rect_fill = TRUE, ggtheme = theme_void())

```

***
Hierarchical clustering with dendrograms is another way to visualise the distance between the documents. 

### Circular Dendogram

```{r}
#Different types of dendogram
fviz_dend(res.hc, cex = 0.8, lwd = 0.8, k= 4,
          rect = TRUE,
          k_colors = "jco",
          rect_border = "jco",
          rect_fill = TRUE,
          type = "circular",
          repel = TRUE)
```

***
Circular dendogram is yet another way to visualise the distance between the documents. 


### Phylogenic Dendogram

```{r}
fviz_dend(res.hc, cex = 0.8, lwd = 0.8, k= 4,
          rect = TRUE,
          k_colors = "jco",
          rect_border = "jco",
          rect_fill = TRUE,
          type = "phylogenic",
          repel = TRUE)
```

***
Phylogenic structure is another way of visualizing the same results with different perspective according to your research problem and dataset.
