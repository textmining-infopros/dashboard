# How to Cite
Please cite this compendium as: **Lamba, Manika & Madhusudhan, Margam. (2021). Build a Dashboard using R (Version 1.2). https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5203304**

# Contents
The compendium contains the code associated with the case study used in Chapter 9. The `flexboard_R.Rmd` file contains the R code for the case study.

# How to Download or Install
There are several ways to use the compendiumâ€™s contents and reproduce
the analysis:

  - **Download the compendium as a zip archive** from this [GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/textmining-infopros/dashboard/archive/main.zip).
    
      - After unpacking the downloaded zip archive, you can explore the
        files on your computer.

  - **Reproduce the analysis in the cloud** without having to install
    any software. The same Docker container replicating the
    computational environment used by the authors can be run using
    BinderHub on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/):
    
      - Click
        **RStudio**: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/textmining-infopros/dashboard/main?urlpath=rstudio) to launch an interactive [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) session in your web browser for hands-on practice for the case study. In the virtual environment, open the `flexboard_R.Rmd` file to run the code.
        
       - Click
        **Jupyter+RMarkdown**: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/textmining-infopros/dashboard/main?filepath=flexdashboard_R.Rmd) to launch an interactive [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) session in your web browser using [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html) kernel to execute [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook session in your web browser. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.
        

       - **Limitations of Binder**
          1. The server has limited memory so you cannot load large datasets or run big computations.
          2. Binder is meant for interactive and ephemeral interactive coding so an instance will die after 10 minutes of inactivity.
          3. An instance cannot be kept alive for more than 12 hours.
